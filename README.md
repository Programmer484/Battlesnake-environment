A Battlesnake environment that allows:
- humans playing against battlesnakes
- setting up custom positions for your battlesnakes

Currently only compatible with battlesnakes coded in python but if anyone has a way to extend the compatibility feel free to fork the repo and implement it!

Eventually planning to use this as the basis for an RL battlesnake.
